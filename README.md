# Tic--tac-toe-game
Tic Tac Toe is a simple and fun two-player game played on a 3×3 grid. Each player takes turns marking a space with X or O. The goal is to place three of your marks in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—before your opponent does. It tests logic, quick thinking, and strategy.
